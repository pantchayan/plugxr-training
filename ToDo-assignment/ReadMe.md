**Assignment Title: Building a ToDo App with Vanilla JavaScript and IndexedDB**

**Objective:**
The objective of this assignment is to create a ToDo application using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and IndexedDB. The app should allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their tasks while practicing the use of Promises for asynchronous operations.

**Requirements:**

1. **HTML/CSS Boilerplate:**
    - You are provided with HTML and CSS boilerplate to kickstart your project. You can modify them as per your requirements.

2. **IndexedDB Setup:**
    - Initialize IndexedDB database to store ToDo tasks.
    - Define object stores to hold task data.

3. **CRUD Operations:**
    - Implement functionality for creating tasks.
    - Implement functionality for reading/displaying tasks.
    - Implement functionality for updating tasks.
    - Implement functionality for deleting tasks.

4. **Promises Implementation:**
    - Utilize Promises to handle asynchronous operations, such as database transactions and data retrieval.

5. **User Interface (UI):**
    - Design a simple and intuitive user interface.
    - Ensure that users can easily add, view, edit, and delete tasks.

6. **Styling:**
    - Apply CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of the app.
    - Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

**Note:**
- This assignment emphasizes practicing CRUD operations using IndexedDB and implementing Promises in JavaScript.
- You are provided with HTML and CSS boilerplate to accelerate the development process.
- Focus on implementing features related to task management and ensure smooth interaction with the IndexedDB database using Promises.
- Feel free to add any additional features or enhancements to make your ToDo app more functional and user-friendly.
