Problem Description :

You need to write JS program to

1. Create a Storage Object names 'ticketsDB' in Browser's localstorage.

```
The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions. 
```

2. Add a new ticket to Storage Object of name 'ticketsDB' in Browser's localstorage.

Hint: 

Let's suppose you are maintaining an array 'ticketsArr' to keep track of data of tickets that are being added. 

You need to make sure that whenever the Input is made in the modal, 
1. ticketsArr is updated with the new ticket information. { ticketTask, ticketColor, ticketID: id }
2. And then ticketsArr is used as a value and Storage Object ticketsDB is updated with it.
