Write a JavaScript program in the script.js file to:

Part 1:

Delete tickets from the UI, 
in this the delete button should activate the delete state 
and whenever a ticket is clicked upon while in delete state => the ticket should get deleted automatically.

You can change the color of delete button to indicate whether delete state is active or inactive. (or add text right next to button about the same)



Part 2:

To update the ticketsArr and ticketsDB Storage Object in the localstorage.


Hint:
You need to write a function first to get the index of the ticket being deleted by matching the ids,
then use this index to delete the item from the ticketArr and then update the ticketsDB with the updated array after stringifying it.
